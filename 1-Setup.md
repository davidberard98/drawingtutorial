# 1. Setup our page

## First: Basic HTML Structure

1. Open atom, caret, or whatever text editor you're using.
2. Make a new file and save it as `editor.html` (or, in fact, *any* word followed by `.html`)
3. Write the basic HTML structure in it.  (The basic HTML structure is written below).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title of my page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    My Content
  </body>
</html>
```

This is the same structure that *all* HTML pages have.

When you're done with this, go on to [Part 2, Other Setup](./2-OtherSetup.md)
