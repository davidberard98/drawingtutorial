# Making Buttons

We're going to need 2 kinds of buttons:

1. [Color buttons](#colorbuttons)
2. [Tool buttons](#toolbuttons) (eraser, marker, paint bucket)

## Color buttons

First let's make a **container** to go around the buttons.

Put the following code **below the image tag from before**

```html
    <div id="colorContainer">
    
    
    </div>
```

Now get your color images.  (If you haven't already made them, go to [pixlr.com](http://pixlr.com) and make one for each color you desire).  For each one, make sure you have **rgb values**

If you don't have the rgb values yet, use [this tutorial for finding RGB values](./4.1-RGB.md)
