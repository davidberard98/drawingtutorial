# 3 - Including an Image

Next we need to add an image to our website.

This image will be the image we can draw on top of.

There are a few rules:

1. Make sure the image is downloaded to your computer before you do these instructions.  It **can't** be using a URL to somewhere else on the internet.
2. The image should have dark lines and a transparent background.

Use this code:

```html
    <img src="[your filename]" />
```

Instead of `[your filename]`, write the actual name of your file.

If you would like your images to go in a separate folder called `images`, then...

1. Make the `images` folder **inside** the folder where your html file is
2. Move your picture into the `images` folder
3. Change `[your filename]` write `images/[your filename]`, where `[your filename]` is replaced with the actual name of your file

When you're done with this, you can move on to (Making Buttons)[./4-Buttons.md]
